# Adventure Time

Information about our game: 

You are a Wheaton College CS student in Mey-Sci at 1am. You are here because of a broken simulation in the matrix and there are monstes, NPCs, and items present in this world.

The objective of this game is to escape the simulation through the Mey-Sci Central Computer. You do this by finding the secret USB port and escaping. Be warned, you can die!

There are some professors in the building. They will give you information and some of them will give you items. Door behaves differently. Some doors are locked until you "unlock" them by using a key in the correct room. Some doors are more interesting. If you fight with the monsters, they will attack back to kill you. The Mastodon who holds the USB you need is really strong. You have to learn the Commands and find items as you move through Mey-Sci to make yourself strong enough to beat the Mastodon. There are also roamers who moving around the world randomly, but if you see them, they cannot move anymore. Go get them! Some of them have valuable loots!
